Conversational AIs driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for querying various information. However, generating high-quality prompts are difficult for common users, leading to repetitive random attempts. In this paper, through formative interviews with a total of 123 participants, we for the first identified the structure of usage and 3 types of problems during conversational AIs' interaction driven by LLM. The mutual ``Ambiguity'' between users and conversational AIs is the main challenge among the problems when interacting with conversational AIs. To resolve this problem, we proposed ProChatter, a web-based user interface that leveraged human-AI collaborative editing to achieve effective querying with conversational AIs. ProChatter enabled the users to selectively modify the prompt by highlighting the words with different levels of ambiguity and proposing suggestions. It also allowed the users to directly edit the output of the AI (e.g., marking and modifying). Combining the visualization and modification, ProChatter enabled users to reach optimized answer efficiently. In the evaluation study, compared with three baseline techniques, ProChatter needed the least interaction time and iteration count to acquire a satisfying answer, and was more preferred by the participants in terms of speed, naturalness and satisfaction.
